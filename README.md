# 4-Bit Ripple Carry Adder Simulation and Analysis
This project involves the design, simulation, and analysis of a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) using HSpice. The primary focus is on evaluating the delay, power consumption, and power-delay product (PDP) of the adder circuit.

__Results__<br/> 
Max Delay (Tp_sum): 1.85ns<br/> 
Max Delay (Tp_cout): 1.43ns<br/>
Average Power Consumption: 227ÂµW<br/>
PDP: 988fJ
